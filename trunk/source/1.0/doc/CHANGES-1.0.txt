Changes in shFlags 1.0.x
========================

Changes with 1.0.1
------------------

Fixed bug where the help output added [no] to all flag names

Added additional example files that are referenced by the documentation.

Improved zsh version and option checking.

Upgraded shUnit2 to 2.1.4

Added unit testing for the help output.

When including a library (e.g. shflags) in a script, zsh 3.0.8 doesn't actually
execute the code in-line, but later. As such, variables that are defined in the
library cannot be used until functions are called from the main code. This
required the 'help' flag definition to be moved inside the FLAGS command.


Changes with 1.0.0
------------------

This is the first official release, so everything is new.
